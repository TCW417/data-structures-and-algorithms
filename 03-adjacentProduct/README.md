## Array Reverse

Find the largest adjacent product of pairs of numbers in a matrix where pairs are formed in all 8 directions from a given [x, y].

## Challenge

Write a function called `LargestProduct` that takes an 2D array parameter. Return the largest product of all adjacent pairs of elements.

## Solution

Travis testing enabled.

This module has an inner (private) function, findMAP, that I had exported during initial development so I could test it using jest.  Once I had it working I "hid" it. Hope this is okay.
